# Nashdale Civic Mesh

**People-first neighborhood mesh** in Hamilton’s Ward 5 (Nashdale).  
We connect local businesses, community orgs, and residents in a shared digital-physical commons — with three layers working together:

- **Civic**: forums, projects, stewardship
- **Digital**: open data, maps, templates, lightweight governance
- **Physical (optional)**: rooftop/backhaul links and shared Wi-Fi/APs
